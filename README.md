## Description

This is a simple boilerplate for building a game with an Entity-Component-System.

If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to contribute.


## Howto use

Clone a copy to your machine and step straight into the Settings-File.
Out of the box the ECS supports to game types:
- Platformer / Jump'n'Run
- Roguelike

This is for just for demo purpose! A proof of concept. If you have chosen one game-type you should definitly clean up the code to eliminate unnecessary code calls.
Furthermore you can speed things up by loosing the third dimension for collider-shapes and collision detection.


## Known Bugs

- when the players upside is blocked and you press the jump-key, jumping gets blocked, until you fall down somewhere


Happy coding!
